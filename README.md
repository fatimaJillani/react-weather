# React Weather App

## Overview
The React Weather App is a web application designed to display current weather data for any location, offering features such as Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature conversion, as well as a 5-day weather forecast.

## Features Implemented
1. **Current Weather Data:** View real-time weather information for a specified location.
2. **Temperature Conversion:** Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature units.
3. **5-Day Weather Forecast:** Access a detailed forecast for the next 5 days.

## Technologies Used
- React
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) for weather data

## Setup / Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fatimaJillani/WeatherApp
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd react-weather-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view the app by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## Usage
1. **Enter Location:**
   - Type the desired location to fetch the current weather and forecast.

2. **Temperature Unit Conversion:**
   - Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius to view temperature in your preferred unit.

3. **5-Day Forecast:**
   - Explore the detailed weather forecast for the next 5 days.

#Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
